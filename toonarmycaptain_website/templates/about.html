                is a handle I adopted in the mid 90's when I need a unique email address, and that's what I came up
                with. Yes, I barrack for Newcastle Utd.</p>

            <p>I'm a man of rather eclectic interests, coming to the world of code via several years of unrelated and
                un-graduated university studies, healthcare, and K12 education, trying to break into tech. I love
                python's syntax, enjoy solving problems, and writing robust, extensively tested code.</p>
